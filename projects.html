    <h3>I love coding because there are so many interesting things I am able to do. Lately, I've grown interested in machine learning and especially natural language processing. Imagine being able to take an unstructured document and getting meaningful information from it. Oh, the power!! <br><br>
    Listed below are a few things that I find interesting (and that use ML and/or NLP) and will be working on in the next few months:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>An Alexa skill
        <!-- <ul> <li>An Amazon Echo is a powerful piece of technology that makes life convenient for all of us and is definitely something that I'm looking to involve myself in </li>
        </ul> -->
      </li>
      <li>Scraping data from ELMS
        <!-- <ul> <li>With many professors having their preferred way of doing things, it would definitely be nice to be able to scrape data about homework due dates, deadlines and exam dates from ELMS </li>
        </ul> -->
      </li>
      <li>Facial recognition
        <!-- <ul> <li>Facial recognition seems very cool <i>and</i> it has tons of practical usages, so it is absolutely something I cannot miss out on!</li>
        </ul> -->
      </li>
      <li>Video transformation in real time
        <!-- <ul> <li>Analysis of video feed in real time is indeed very useful, but I can go a step further and actually modify the feed in real time. Now <i>that's</i> what I call poweful. This could be useful in extracting useful information or applying all sorts of cool filters. Zoom University taken to the next level!!
        </li>
      </ul> -->
    </ul>

    <h2 id="test"> <u>Social Media Simulation</u> </h2>
    <h3>Created a simplified physical model of a social media platform to represent the idea of the tangibility of data, and how it can be used to gather information about users without their knowledge.
    <br><br>
    Used an Arduino Mega to control 24 (physical) buttons to simultaneously collect and process data, and the Arduino Serial library to communicate data to a Python script using the PySerial library, for analysis and visualization via Matplotlib. <br><br>
